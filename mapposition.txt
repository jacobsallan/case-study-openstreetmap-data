This is the pre-defined download for Los Angeles, California.

Among the extracts, it was one of the largest.  76 MB zipped.  It uses English names
and most of its streets are named.  I also looked at Prague and Tokyo downloads, but
decided that my inability to understand the meaning of the entries would limit my ability
to analyze and clean them.  I used to live in Los Angeles, so there is an entertainment
factor involved in the choice, too.
